Next Step: Chapter 4

# Project Introduction
A dashboard application containing different features of NextJS. This serves as a great refresher and an opportunity to seek for feature candies that I have missed previously, especially after working on too many infrastructure and backend projects recently. This project repository is a follow along from the [NextJS official](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/) website.


## Personal notes/learning points
- A really great refresher of the core NextJS features to work with, and extra helpful if you've worked with `React` before. 
- `clsx` library is great for toggling `if else` clauses on classes.
- `next/font` to build fonts instead of runtime load.
- `next/image` to allow automatic optimisation of images by using `<Image>` tag instead of usual `<img>` (place it in `/public`). 
- `className="hidden md:block"` helps to remove image from DOM on mobile screens and md:block to show on desktop screens, and inversely `block md:hidden`.
- `page.tsx` for base navigation routes in a particular folder and `layout.tsx` for sharing UI between multiple pages (helps with partial rendering).


- There was also quizzes during the tutorial walkthrough to test your understanding which was extremely helpful.

## What's next after this repository?
Time to utilise the knowledge to dish out some fancy frontends in my side projects.
